# Mortal_Komat_2D_Ripoff_Edition
This project is a fun, Python-based game titled "Mortal Kombat Ripoff 2D Edition." It features an AI agent trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The AI adapts to in-game scenarios, delivering an engaging gameplay experience as it learns and improves its strategies through continuous play.

Features:

Python-based 2D fighting game mechanics.
AI agent trained with the PPO algorithm for smart decision-making.
Real-time learning and adaptation for more challenging gameplay.
Customizable reward functions to fine-tune agent behavior.
Modular codebase for easy expansion and feature integration.
Technologies Used: Python, Reinforcement Learning (RL), PPO algorithm
